Chargify API wrapper for PHP
Christopher Lewis, 2009 (lewsid@lewsid.com)

This is a basic PHP wrapper for the Chargify API.

Example Usage:

1. Create an instance of the ChargifyConnector object, and whether you want to run it in test mode or not:

  $test_mode = false;
  $connector = new ChargifyConnector($test_mode);

2. This class has many helpful functions that can be used to retrieve information from Chargify:

  $products = $connector->getAllProducts();

3. You can also create a subscription:

   $sub = $connector->createCustomerAndSubscription($post_xml);
